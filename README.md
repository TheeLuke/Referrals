# Referrals (Java Minecraft Server Plugin)
## By Luke Sullivan

**This plugin was made for version 1.19**

### About
This plugin was made for a Java Minecraft server known as 'EnvisionSMP'. I was a developer for a short period of time and was requested to make a plugin that allowed new players to type "/referral <username>" to indicate who referred them to play on the server. After executing the command, both users will receive rewards for using the referral system. There is also a referral leaderboard, creating incentive to users to invite their friends for more rewards and status.

### Features
- Commands for indicating referral, leaderboards, referral status and progress
- Rewards system for successful referrals
- Runs checks to check for alt accounts and other ways to break the referral system
- Creates and stores player data in organized files
- Messages and rewards configurable through configuration files
